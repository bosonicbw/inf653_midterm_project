# INF653 Midterm Project â€“ Quotes API
### By: Brandon Williams

This is my PHP REST API for the INF653 midterm. It uses PHP to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Render.

## What It Does

Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for:

- Quotes
- Authors
- Categories

All endpoints are in `/api/` and everything is tested and working.

## Live Link

Deployed with Docker on Render:  
https://inf653-midterm-project-iiwk.onrender.com/

## Notes

CORS headers are included, all required test cases pass, and database entries for author ID 5 and quote ID 10 are in place.
